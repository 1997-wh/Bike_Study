# Bike Study
## Overview
### The goal of this analysis is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. By examining historical bike trip data, we aim to design a marketing strategy that effectively converts casual riders into annual members. This project addresses the following key questions:
#### How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
#### Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
#### How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Skills Utilized
### Data Cleaning: Cleaned and prepared data using Excel and R.
### Data Analysis: Conducted analyses to uncover usage patterns and trends.
### Data Visualization: Created visualizations in R to communicate findings.
### Statistical Analysis: Examined seasonal trends and ridership behaviors.

## Findings
### Casual riders spent more time on bikes, while annual members tended to ride for shorter durations.
### The number of casual riders increased on weekends, with Saturday being the most popular day for bike rentals. Sunday was the second most popular day for casual users.
### Casual riders often use bikes for recreational activities, such as picnics, while annual members use them for general purposes like commuting to school.
### Seasonal fluctuations were evident in ridership, with peak usage during the summer months and a significant drop from late fall to early spring, especially among casual users.

## Recommendations
### Weekend Discounts: Offer discounts to casual users who purchase annual memberships, particularly on weekends, to incentivize conversion.
### Seasonal Passes: Introduce discounted seasonal passes to attract casual riders during peak usage times, allowing them to experience membership benefits at a lower cost.
### Promote Eco-Friendly Options: Provide discounts for businesses to encourage employees to cycle to work, making cycling a more attractive option for casual riders.

## Conclusion
### The insights derived from this analysis will help Cyclistic tailor its marketing strategies to effectively convert casual riders into annual members, enhancing user engagement and overall ridership.
